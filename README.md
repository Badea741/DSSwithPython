## Course     : Decision Support Systems for Industrial Engineers
##### Code       : ESI 4628
##### Year       : 2018
##### Level      : Undergraduate
##### Department : Industrial Engineering and Management Systems Department
##### College of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida

### Goals
+ To make student familiar with fundamental methods for building data-driven decision support systems with the popular programming language, Python (https://www.python.org/). 
+ In addition, basic decision support methodology will be presented along with modern data science techniques.

### Objectives
+ To develop advanced programming skills in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment (http://jupyter.org). By the end of the course the learner should be competent in using Python programming to manipulate data objects, ingest data, create data-driven models, and produce advanced data visualization.

+ To use the previously learned skills to develop a complete data-driven decision support system for analyzing and modeling a real-world industrial engineering problems.
